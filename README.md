# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the numpy library as np.
### Step 2: Create or read the matrix for which the rank has to be calculated.
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: Print the rank of the matrix.
